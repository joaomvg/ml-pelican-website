I'm a theoretical physicist with more than 5+years postdoctoral research experience. I have worked on many topics in string theory, from the old on-shell strings to the more modern holographic correspondence between gravity and quantum field theory. My expertise is in statistical modelling of quantum black holes, more precisely on the connection between black hole entropy and number theory.

Recently, I have been interested in machine learning and data science. Much like most of the people in the field, I got hooked by recent developments in deep learning. One great advantage in these fields, in contrast to physics, is that one can run the experiments on the computer and test our models right away. This fascinates me.

My goal is to bring the insights I have learnt from physics and applied them in this field. But first, let's start with the fundamentals and basic building blocks of machine learning.
