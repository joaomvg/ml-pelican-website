Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics webpage. I explain the theory, technical details, and Python implementation of various machine learning algorithms and statistics concepts.

Some of the topics include mathematical foundation of machine learning like PAC learnability, Rademacher complexity or VC dimension, important statistical  concepts like Student's t-test or Pearson's Chi-square test and implementation from scratch of various machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Gradient boosting, Adaboosting, etc. 

I tried to include original derivations as much as possible. However, for the sake of simplicty of the blog webpage some details were omitted.
