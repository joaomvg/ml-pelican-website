# Bio

I'm a theoretical physicist with more than 5+years postdoctoral research experience. I have worked on several topics in string theory, from the old on-shell strings to the modern holographic correspondence between gravity and quantum field theory. My expertise, though, is in the statistical modelling of quantum black holes, more precisely on the connection between black hole entropy and number theory.

These days I have been interested in machine learning and data science. Like many of the people in the field, I got hooked by the recent developments in deep learning. I find fascinating that one can run machine learning experiments on the computer. In physics we poke the universe and see what comes out of it, but with a computer, that can fit in your lap, it seems, paradoxically, that one can access multiple universes.

My goal is to bring the insights I have learnt from physics and applied them in this field. But first, let's start with the fundamentals and basic building blocks of machine learning.
